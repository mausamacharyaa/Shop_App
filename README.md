# Shopping App 
A simple shopping app I'm building while learning Flutter. Still a work in progress, but getting there!

## What's This?
Just a basic e-commerce demo app where you can browse products, add stuff to your cart, and checkout. Nothing fancy yet, but I'm adding features as I learn more about Flutter.

## Features (so far)
- Home page with product listings
- Product details view
- Shopping cart functionality
- Basic UI with Material Design

## Tech Stack
- Flutter
- Dart
- Material Design 3

## Getting Started
If you want to run this on your machine:
1. Make sure you have Flutter installed
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter run` to start the app

## What I'm Learning
This project is helping me understand:
- Flutter widgets and layouts
- State management
- Navigation between screens
- Building responsive UIs

## Todo
- [ ] Add more products
- [ ] Improve the cart page
- [ ] Add checkout functionality
- [ ] Make it look better lol

## Issues

If something's broken, it's probably because I'm still figuring things out ahahaha.
